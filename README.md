# Smart-Campus-Navigation-Crowd-Density-Monitoring-System
A smart campus system that tracks real-time crowd density across locations like libraries, cafeterias, and labs. Student apps send live locations to a server, which updates crowd levels and shows them on a color-coded map, recommends less busy spots, and saves data for analysis.
